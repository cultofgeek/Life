The Game of Life by Won You 8/10/2002


This program was developed in MSVC 6. The game--I use this term loosely-- 
simply implements the rules that were originally developed by Conway 
during his study of Cellular Automata.  The GUI was created using MFC
and borrows heavily from James Matthews' PenteAI.  Since this is my
first releasable attempt at programming windows with MFC, the user
should not be too critical of the way things are done.  If I was to
redo the program, I probably wouldn't use the Doc/View architecture,
because this program really doesn't take advantage of it.
